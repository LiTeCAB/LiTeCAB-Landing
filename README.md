# LiTeCAB

**Life Cycle Assessment & Techno-Economic Analysis for Battery Processes**

LiTeCAB is a desktop application that helps researchers and engineers evaluate the environmental impacts, costs, and material circularity of lithium-ion battery manufacturing and recycling processes.

It ships with built-in TRACI v2.1 impact data and process templates so teams can go from a process concept to LCA and TEA results without external databases, Python, or backend setup.

### Capabilities

- **LCA** — 9 TRACI v2.1 impact categories with process-level contribution breakdowns
- **TEA** — Material, labor, and operational cost modeling per process
- **Circularity** — Material circularity metrics across key battery materials
- **Templates** — NMC111, NMC622, NMC811, LFP manufacturing and BRAWS recycling
- **Custom workflows** — Upload your own process data via CSV
